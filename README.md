# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction



## 🔍 **Problem Statement**

A telecommunications company wants to predict **customer churn** — whether a customer will leave the company or not.  
The dataset contains various customer details such as **contract type, monthly charges, tenure**, etc.  
Your task is to **pre-process the data** and **train multiple classification models** to predict customer churn effectively.

## 🎯 **Objectives**

### 1. 🧹 **Data Preprocessing**
- Handle missing values  
- Encode categorical features (e.g., contract type) into numeric form  
- Normalize or scale numerical features  
- Split the dataset into **75% training** and **25% testing**

### 2. 🧠 **Modeling**
Train and evaluate the following classification algorithms:
- Naive Bayes  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

### 3. 📈 **Evaluation**
Evaluate models using:
- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-score  
- ROC-AUC  
- Confusion Matrix  

Finally, **compare and justify** which model performs best for predicting churn.
